## ES6 updates

Rewritten from the ground up for ES6 + React with Babel and webpack.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run dist
npm run start
```

Now the app should be running at http://localhost:8000/

## Considerations
Need to be a Single Page Application
Need to be PWA


## Scripts

The `package.json` file comes with the following scripts that you may find useful:

* `npm start` runs a client-only production
* `npm run start-dev` run develop mode
* `npm run watch` runs a dev console that reports lint and unit test errors on save

To run a script, open the terminal, navigate to the boilerplate directory, and type:

```
npm run <name of script>
```
